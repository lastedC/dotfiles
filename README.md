# lasted's "dotfiles"
Hey there! üëã

It looks like you've stumbled upon my personal "dotfiles" git repo. What is a dotfile you may ask? A dotfile is any form of configuration, customisation theme file or etc. that I use to personalise any products I may use. This is a repository that I created in order to backup these files in case I lose them.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware, some of these files may be outdated if they haven't been used in a while. I only keep files that I use updated so be aware that not all of these files may work.

# Icons with Nerd-Fonts
To display all the icons in terminal and applications, I use fonts available on a website called [Nerd-Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). I am currently using **Hack Nerd Font Mono** in terminals, and **Hack Nerd Font** in applications.
